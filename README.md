# A Category Extension plugin for Human: Fall Flat speedrun.

## Rule: 
Fall into the void to finish level. You can not drown, you can only pass by triggering the fallTrigger below the map!

## Usage:
By default, when you first loaded the plugin, Fall% mode will be turned on. You can turn it off via the `Fall` command (type `help fall` for more information), or navigate to `<game directory>/BepInEx/config/com.kirisoup.hff.fall.cfg` and change the config. 

Your config options will always be saved and remembered when you launch the game at any time.
